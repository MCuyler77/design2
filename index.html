        <p> Make your products live longer!
            Repairing means taking the opportunity to give your product a second life. Don’t ditch it, stitch it! Don’t end it, mend it! Repairing is not anti-consumption. It is anti- needlessly throwing things away.

<div class="number2text">
          <p>  Things should be designed so that they can be repaired.
            Product designers: Make your products repairable. Share clear, understandable information about DIY repairs. Consumers: Buy things you know can be repaired, or else find out why they don’t exist. Be critical and inquisitive.

<div class="number3text">
          <p>  Repair is not replacement.
            Replacement is throwing away the broken bit. This is NOT the kind of repair that we’re talking about.

<div class="number4">

<div class="number4text">
          <p>  What doesn’t kill it makes it stronger.
            Every time we repair something, we add to its potential, its history, its soul and its
            inherent beauty.
            </div>

<div class="number5text">
          <p>  Repairing is a creative challenge.
            Making repairs is good for the imagination. Using new techniques, tools and materials ushers in possibility rather than dead ends

<div class="number6text">
          <p>  Repair survives fashion.
            Repair is not about styling or trends. There are no due-dates for repairable items.
            </div>
<div class="number7">

  </div>
<div class="number7text">
            <p>To repair is to discover.
            As you fix objects, you’ll learn amazing things about how they actually work. Or don’t work.
</div>
<div class="number8">

  </div>
<div class="number8text">
          <p>  Repair – even in good times!
            If you think this manifesto has to do with the recession, forget it. This isn’t about money, it’s about a mentality.
</div>
<div class="number9">
  <img src="images/9.png">
  </div>
<div class="number9text">
          <p>  Repaired things are unique.
            Even fakes become originals when you repair them.
            </div>
<div class="number10">

  </div>
<div class="number10text">
          <p>  Repairing is about independence.
            Don’t be a slave to technology – be its master. If it’s broken, fix it and make it better. And if you’re a master, empower others.
</div>
<div class="number11">

  </div>
<div class="number11text">
          <p>  You can repair anything, even a plastic bag.
            But we’d recommend getting a bag that will last longer, and then repairing it if necessary.
